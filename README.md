Dummier
=======

**Under construction**

A smart gem with a dumb name; Dummier is a rails generator for automating the creation of rails testing applications. These applications usually live in test/dummy, and we see them alot.

It's just not cool having so many empty, un-loved rails apps hiding away in the /test directory of all these fun gems. Let's give them some more attention by using dummier to make it exciting to generate these apps!

Once dummier is ready for action, you'll cd into your existing gem and run `dummier`.

You can create custom hooks that fire along the way by placing the appropriately named files in `your_gem/lib/dummy_hooks/hook_name.rb`.

That's all for now.
