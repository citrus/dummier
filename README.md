Dummier
=======

A smart gem with a dumb name; Dummier is a rails generator for automating the creation of rails testing applications. 

Dummier was inspired by [JosÃ© Valim](https://github.com/josevalim)'s [enginex](https://github.com/josevalim/enginex) which creates a standard gem structure for you. Enginex creates a `test/dummy` app for you, but what if we want to re-create it? Or leave it out of git?

The idea behind Dummier is that we don't check `test/dummy` into git, but rather generate it on the fly for the gems we're developing. It just seems [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)'er that way.

Dummier is simple; just run the binary from your gem's root directory and it will generate a stripped-down & gem-dev-ready rails app in `test/dummy`. While it's doing it's thing, Dummer triggers a few hooks along the way for easy customization.

To catch the hooks, just create appropriatly named files in `lib/dummy_hooks` inside your gem. See **Hooks** below for more info.


Installation
------------

To install from RubyGems:

    gem install dummier

To install with bundler:

    gem 'dummier', '>= 0.1.0'

To package for development in your gemspec:
    
    s.add_development_dependency('dummier', '>= 0.1.0')
    
    
Usage
-----

After you've installed Dummier, just `cd` into the gem your developing and run the binary:

    dummier
    
If you're in a gem that uses bundler, you may have to run the binary with `bundle exec`: 

    bundle exec dummier
    

Hooks
-----
    
Dummier calls the following hooks along the way:

    before_delete
    before_app_generator
    after_app_generator
    before_migrate
    after_migrate
    
    
Place appropriatly named files in `lib/dummy_hooks` and dummier will find and execute them automatically! 

You can use [Rails::Generators::Actions](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html) as well as [Thor::Actions](http://textmate.rubyforge.org/thor/Thor/Actions.html) in your hooks. Also, since hooks are just `eval`'d into the Dummer::AppGenerator, you have access to all of [those methods](http://rubydoc.info/gems/dummier/0.1.0/Dummier/AppGenerator) as well. 
    
    
### Simple Example

Here's a `before_migrate.rb` hook that will install [Spree Commerce](https://github.com/spree/spree) by running some rake commands before migrating the `test/dummy` database.

    # lib/dummy_hooks/before_migrate.rb
    say_status "installing", "spree_core, spree_auth and spree_sample"
    rake "spree_core:install spree_auth:install spree_sample:install"
    
    
### More Complex Example

Here's an example taken from [has_magick_title](https://github.com/citrus/has_magick_title):

    # lib/dummy_hooks/after_app_generator.rb
    run "rails g scaffold post title:string"
    
    gsub_file "app/models/post.rb", "end", %(
      has_magick_title
      
    end)
    
    gsub_file "config/routes.rb", "resources :posts", %(
      resources :posts
      root :to => "posts#index")
    
    gsub_file "app/views/posts/show.html.erb", "<%= @post.title %>", %(
      <%= magick_title_for @post %>)


Testing
-------

    cd dummier
    bundle install
    rake


Enjoy!
